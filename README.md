# Entity Field Form Require Drupal Module

## Summary

For entity fields, the idea of "required" is confusing. Is the field required to create the entity? Or is the field input required on a form, but only for some roles? With Drupal 8 and [constraints](https://www.drupal.org/docs/drupal-apis/entity-api/entity-validation-api/defining-constraints-validations-on-entities-andor-fields), it became harder to programmatically change `#required` in a form hook. We needed a better way to make fields required only for some form use cases and not for others. This module addresses that need.
